# Localbuzz
This project creates an interactive buzzer system using Java Swing and key events. The program displays a graphical interface where pressing specific keys triggers corresponding actions. Each keypress activates a buzzer sound, changes the display label to a designated house name, and updates the label color. This setup is ideal for use cases like quiz systems, where participants' keypresses signal their responses.
